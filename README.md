Custom Mini-Shell Implementation (minishell)This project implements a simple, custom command-line shell in C++ for the Linux operating system, fulfilling the requirements for Assignment 2: Custom Shell Implementation.Project ObjectiveThe objective is to build a functional shell environment that can:Read and parse user commands.Execute basic external programs (like ls, cat, echo).Manage basic process control (exit and later, foreground/background).Implement I/O redirection and piping.Build and Run InstructionsPrerequisitesA Linux environment (or macOS/WSL)GNU C++ Compiler (g++)CompilationNavigate to the project directory and compile the source file:g++ -o minishell minishell.cpp
ExecutionRun the compiled executable:./minishell
Basic UsageThe shell will present a prompt: minishell>.Type a command and press Enter.External Command Example: minishell> ls -lBuilt-in Exit: minishell> exitImplementation Status & To-Do ListThis project is built incrementally following the assignment's Day-wise Tasks.Assignment DayFeature ObjectiveStatusImplementation DetailsDay 1Plan features and parse user input.COMPLETEImplemented the main shell loop (shell_loop), basic input reading (std::getline), and fundamental tokenization (tokenize). The shell can recognize the command and its arguments.Day 2Implement execution of basic commands.COMPLETEImplemented command execution using fork(), execvp(), and waitpid() for synchronous (foreground) command execution.Day 3Add support for process management (foreground/background).PENDINGNeed to detect the & symbol during parsing and call waitpid() with WNOHANG or skip waiting if running in the background.Day 4Implement piping (`) and **redirection** (<, >`).PENDINGDay 5Incorporate job control (listing jobs, bringing jobs to foreground/background).PENDINGRequires maintaining a global list of background processes (jobs) and implementing built-in commands like jobs, fg, and bg.Next Steps (Focus for Day 3)Enhance tokenize: Modify the tokenize function to correctly handle special characters like |, <, >, and & as separate tokens, even if they are not surrounded by spaces (e.g., ls>output.txt should tokenize as ls, >, output.txt).Implement & detection: Modify execute_command to check for & as the last token to run a process in the background.Implement Job Listing: Start creating a structure to track background processes (PID and command string) for job control.
